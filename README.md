#Memoize Function

https://ethyl2.github.io/memoize/

I wrote this page in response to the following challenge:

'Write a JavaScript function that takes only one argument——another function——and returns a "memoized" version of that function. A "memoized" version of a function caches and returns the results of its call so that when it is called again with the same input, it doesn’t run its computation but instead returns the results from cache. Note that previous results should be retrievable in any order without re-computation.'
